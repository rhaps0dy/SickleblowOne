=============

This was going to be a big game, but it ended up in just me learning. I did tell the artists to go 2D!

The graphics do not accurately match what's happening. This project isn't finished and probably won't
ever be. Unless I really get back into game development but it doesn't look like that's gonna happen.

Building
========

Standard CMake procedure. You'll need Ogre3D and Chipmunk Physics.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui .. #now configure your variables
make && make install

Playing
=======

Arrows walk, space jumps.
